This is a Machine Learning Application using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
architecture. The RNN was implemented using Long Short-term memory (LSTM)
cells. This type of deep learning algorithm is best suited for the situation
given that the data input is a time series and the goal is to predict future
Bitcoin prices. The LSTM model is a type of RNN model which means it process' past information to make future predictions. An advantage that comes with
using the LSTM model is that it can better handle dealing with relationships
in data that were seperated by long periods of time. For example,
cryptocurrency traders might wonder if an event that happened 2 weeks ago
had any affect on todays data of Bitcoin prices. The LSTM model can better
handle this scenario and will prove to be one of the better options of RNN
architecture for predicting future Bitcoin prices.
